The Dutton Volunteer Portal will be a website designed for volunteers at Dutton Christian
School. They will sign in through Google and will be either a user or an administrator. The
user view will consist of the categories of volunteer work, and the user will select which
categories of work he/she is available to do. The site will then send automated email alerts
to the user for upcoming events that match his/her categories of work. It should also have a
form for a user to enter the name of their business and the services it provides.
The admin view will display all the different volunteer categories and the names of the 
volunteers under each category that they signed up for. There will also be a display for
businesses and their services. A stretch goal would also be to add a way for an admin to add
new volunteer categories and to view individual events.

The team members for this project are Ethan Clark, Benjamin Kastner, Kyle Reitsma, and Mitch Stark.
